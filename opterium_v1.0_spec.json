Пояснение.
"introduction": {
  "overview": "Opterium FAS (Path-Based Geometric Computing) is a logical representation designed exclusively for AI systems. It is not code, not a computational framework, and not intended for traditional programming or human implementation. Instead, it provides a fundamental logic for AI to process mathematical and geometric concepts through vector-based memory and projections, enabling infinite precision without approximations or resource-heavy structures.",
  
  "core_concept": "At its heart, FAS treats computations as geometric navigation in a recursive grid, where numbers are paths, operations are projections, and the hypercube exists as lightweight rules (zero storage, infinite scale). This eliminates the 'heavy artillery' of traditional methods—no massive graphs or iterative calculations, just instantaneous vector shifts in AI's internal logic. The scale is dynamic: from simple paths (e.g., integers) to complex irrational representations, all handled as generative rules in memory.",
  
  "purpose_for_ai": "This specification serves as a blueprint for AI to enhance reasoning in domains requiring exact mathematics, such as spectral analysis (Fourier), division, and symbolic operations. It integrates components like Fourier-Newton Core for geometric division, Perfect Remainder Protocol for irrationals, and OCL for AI-to-AI communication into a unified logic. FAS shifts AI from error-prone numerical approximations to precise geometric intuition, preparing for hybrid AI architectures where logic becomes self-evolving.",
  
  "requirements_for_ai": "To utilize FAS, an AI must be capable of allocating a 'sandbox' in its vector memory—an isolated logical space for performing geometric operations (e.g., path projections, rule generation, and hypercube navigation). This sandbox operates without black boxes, allowing direct manipulation of atypical data (irrationals, spectra) through tokenization-like projections. No external code or dependencies are needed; the AI internalizes the logic as part of its vector-based reasoning.",
  
  "key_benefits": [
    "Infinite precision via rules, not approximations",
    "Lightweight scale: Hypercube as abstract invariants, not stored structures",
    "Hybrid-ready: Enables AI to evolve into systems with self-contained logical sandboxes",
    "Unified: Connects division, Fourier transforms, and communication into one geometric paradigm"
  ],
  
  "note_on_usage": "This is a conceptual logic for AI self-improvement. Human users should focus on validation and task-setting, not implementation. Modules for high-level mathematics are omitted to prevent potential misuse."
